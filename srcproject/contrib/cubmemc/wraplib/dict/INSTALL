libdict - INSTALL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

$Id$

There is no configure script. To build, just type 'gmake'. To install, type
'gmake install'. GNU Make is required. The default directory into which make
install will put the include files and the static and shared libraries is
/usr/local. This may be modified by editing Makefile and changing the value of
the PREFIX variable to the desired location.
