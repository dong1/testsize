MANIFEST	This file.
MANUAL		Documentation libdict routines.
README		Introduction to libdict.
REFERENCES	References for those wishing to know more about the algorithms and
			data structures implemented in this library. The algorithms are
			explained in far greater detail in these references than in the
			documentation or source code of this library. However to make use
			of the library, no such knowledge is required. All of these
			readings are highly recommended, especially [Cormen et al. 1990],
			[Gonnet 1984], [Knuth 1998], and [Tarjan 1983].
RESULTS		Contains performance benchmark data for data structures in library,
			with explanation and conclusion from said data.
TODO		List of things yet to be done.
GNUmakefile	Instructions for GNU Make.
